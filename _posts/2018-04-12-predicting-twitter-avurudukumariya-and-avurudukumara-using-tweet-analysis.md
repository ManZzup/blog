Hey,

I was bored and thought of making this #AvurudLK thing a bit interesting for me. (Obviously the games doesn't interest me enough)
I will update this with this and that later, but now I need to quickly upload my predictions. So voila.

**NOTE**
This is done just for my own curiosity and boredom. ALL data used in this are public data and if you have any issues with this, deal with it yourself. But in case you don't want your twitter handle displayed here, let me know.

## Avurudu Kumariya

Accorinding to this, the winner is **@WindDesika**

Let me explain later how I derived the metrics, but in one of the metric stages **@waz_tennakoon** had the upperhand. But I believe the current metric is more accurate.


## Avurudu Kumara

Accorinding to this, the winner is **@MaaluPaan**

Interesting thing about this is, the original Top 5 I got from the metrics was not this. It's the one below. So I had to filter out the final competitors to derive the result we need. Anyways the first place had no change.

I plan to update the post with more analysis, but I want to get this out before official announcement of the results.
