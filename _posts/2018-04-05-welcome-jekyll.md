> #### A programmer's reasoning for Jekyll over Blogspot, Medium and Wordpress

After deliberating for months, I finally decided to move the blog into [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Since my previous blog, hosted in blogspot was getting stale and craming with spammers, I wanted to find a better option that gives me better control. It was hard to move away from the original blog given that it had a substantial(nope) traction already.  

If you are pondering the same things as me, and confused over to which blogging platform you want to move next, let me explain why I chose Jekyll.

------------------

### Jekyll vs Blogspot

Oh this is easy, I've got a sh*t load of dirt on [Blogspot](http://blogspot.com)

| Blogspot        | Jekyll           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Templating is hard, really really hard      | You know HTML, CSS and markdown? That's all you need to know |
| No control over my data      | I literally host my own data (Well thank you github)      |
| Syntax highlight support is non-existing | Again it's markdown      |
| Provides image hosting and Google Drive support | **As for now, no such support** |
| Statistics are managed by the paltform | Google Analytics would fill the gap |

-------------------

### Jekyll vs Wordpress

This was my second option, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) is neat and managing is lesser pain in the arse.

| Wordpress | Jekyll |
| Wordpress.com sub-domain is ugly, custom domains are expensive | Obviously I don't pay for github |
| External hosting is also expensive | Not expensive
| Platform is bulky, I just need a simple text editor with syntax highlighting | You get that and no more |
| Provides a easy access CMS dashboard | **All I get is a text-editor for managing content** | 
| Images *sigh* | **No Image hosting** |

--------------------

### Jekyll vs Medium

Honestly, I only touched [Medium](https://medium.com/) to see what's the hype about it. The platform is beautiful and easy but repuslsively restricting.

| Medium | Jekyll |
| Restricted AF | Nada- No restrictions |
| Can't use custom domains | Can, obviously |
| More exposure, I think | **Ain't nobody coming to check this organically** |

--------------------

Makes sense now I guess for my selection. In summary what lacks in Jekyll are those
1. No image hosting support (I mean you can manually host of course)
2. No easy content management
3. No automated exposure to your content

Given the pro's it gives, I'd stick with Jekyll and will see how I can minimize the above issues. May be a plugin or two might get in the way.
